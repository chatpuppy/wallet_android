## Chatpuppy mobile wallet(android and IOS) is based on AlphaWallet under MIT clause.

We have added 2 important methods to support encrypting and decrypting messages, these 2 methods are exactly same as Metamask website extensions which is: 

* getEncryptionPublicKey 
* decrypt

We donâ€™t change other ready functions and just keep as AlphaWallet did.

Please go to https://github.com/alphawallet to get more information about AlphaWallet.
